# STUPID EXPRESS!!!!!!!!!

### roles I saw in Among Us mods or other ideas put into a single mod

---

#### Roles (as of right now):
- **Amnesiac**: A neutral role that can take the role of any dead body it finds, though they have to choose wisely as the role sticks for the rest of the game.
- **Arsonist**: A neutral role that is on their own team. Their goal is to douse all players and ignite them all. Igniting too early doesn't bode well for the Arsonist, however...

yea that's it
